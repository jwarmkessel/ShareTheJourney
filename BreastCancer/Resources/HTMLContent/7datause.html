<p>Your coded data will be made available to researchers worldwide. By analyzing the data from all participants in the study, researchers may be able to better understand the symptoms that occur after breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>We hope that together we can:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
	<li>Understand differences in symptoms that occur after treatment</li>
	<li>Assess whether mobile devices and sensors can measure and better manage these symptoms</li> 
	<li>Ultimately improve the quality of life after Breast Cancer Treatment</li>
</ul>
