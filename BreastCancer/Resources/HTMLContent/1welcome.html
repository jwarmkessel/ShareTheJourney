<p><boldie>How can we better understand and manage the symptoms of Breast Cancer treatment together?</boldie> </p>Â 

<p>Sage Bionetworks (sagebase.org), a non profit research organization, and research partners are inviting you to participate in a research study to understand variations in symptoms during recovery from breast cancer treatment.<br /><br /> 

You can participate whether you have had breast cancer or not.  This study is designed for women between 18 and 80 years old with a history of breast cancer treatment and women without any history of cancer. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.<br /><br />

We want to understand why some Breast Cancer Survivors recover faster than others, why their symptoms vary over time and what can be done to make the symptoms improve.</p>
