  <p><p>We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy.  This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research study data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, in the event of unauthorized access it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual.  This risk, while low, should be considered before enrolling.</p>
  
  <p>However, even with removal of this information, your data may be accidentally disclosed due to an unintended data breach or hacking.</p>
