            You need to have the Share the Journey app on your phone in order to participate in this study. Each person who enrolls will first complete a consent process explaining the risks and benefits of the study. As part of this process you will also confirm your agreement to participate in the study. Afterward, we will ask you to complete an electronic registration process. Registration will include entering your email address and other general information about you.</p>
            
            <p><boldie>2. Complete Health Surveys</boldie><br /> We will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical history, and current health. You may choose to leave any questions you do not wish to answer blank. Additionally, we will ask you daily, weekly and monthly questions about how your symptoms are changing. With these questions as well, you can leave any questions that you do not wish to answer blank.</p>
            
            <p><boldie>3. Complete Tasks</boldie><br /> We may ask you to perform specific tasks while using your mobile phone, such as to provide a journal about your week with symptoms. </p>
            
            <p><boldie>4. Provide data</boldie><br /> To better understand the way that your symptoms are affecting your life, we will ask your permission to collect data from your phone itself, such as how much you moved in one day. Providing this information is completely optional, and you can turn on and off sending this data at any time. </p>
           	
            <p>
            These surveys and tasks should take you no more than 20 minutes each week. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions or participate in particular aspects of the study.<br /><br />

We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys. You may choose to act at your convenience, either then or later and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study.
