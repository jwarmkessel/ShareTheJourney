    <strong>SUMMARY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are invited to participate in a research study to understand variations in symptoms during recovery from breast cancer treatment. This study is
    designed for women between 18 and 80 years old with a history of breast cancer treatment and women without any history of cancer. Your participation in
    this study is entirely voluntary.
</p>
<p>
    To be in a research study you must give your informed consent. The purpose of this form is to help you decide if you want to participate in this study.
    Please read the information carefully. If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be given a copy of this signed and dated consent form.
    If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent, and to discontinue participation at any time.
</p>
<p>
    You should not join the research study until all of your questions are answered.
</p>
<p>
    Participating in a research study is not the same as receiving medical care. The decision to join or not join the research study will not affect your
    medical benefits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Women recovering from breast cancer treatment can have very different and more or less severe symptoms day to day. These symptoms affect quality of life
    and make managing recovery difficult. We would like to understand the causes of these symptom variations.
</p>
<p>
    New technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time. This study will monitor your health and symptoms using
    questionnaires and sensors via a mobile phone application.
</p>
<p>
    If you decide to join the study you will need to download the study application on your mobile device. Then, periodically we will ask you to answer
    questions and/or perform some tasks on your mobile phone. These questions may be about your health, exercise, diet, sleep and medicines, in addition to
    some more general health surveys. The tasks may include exercising or journaling about your week. Your study data will include your responses to surveys
    and tasks and some measurements from the phone itself about how you are moving and interacting with others.
</p>
<p>
    Your data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants and made available to groups of researchers worldwide for analysis and
    future research. You also will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data. We anticipate this study will be open for multiple years,
    during which time your data will remain available to you to review. We anticipate enrolling 20,000 subjects in this study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PROCEDURES</strong>
<p>
    <strong>What will you be asked to do?</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Download a mobile app (free) and register an account:</strong> You need to have the study app on your phone, register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study. Registration will include entering your name, email address and other general information about yourself to verify your eligibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Surveys</strong>: We will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical history, and your current health. You may choose to
    leave any questions that you do not wish to answer blank. We will ask you to rate your fatigue, cognition, sleep, mood and exercise performance on a scale
    of 1 to 5 daily. In addition to these daily questions we will ask you to answer brief weekly and monthly surveys about your symptoms in order to track any
    changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Tasks</strong>: Occasionally we will ask you to perform specific tasks while using your mobile phone and record sensor data directly from your
    phone. For example, you may be asked to type a short journal entry, which will then be shared and analyzed for typing speed and accuracy as well as word
    usage. Additionally, you may be asked to provide data from third-party fitness devices (like the Fitbit or Jawbone Up) with your permission.</li>
    
</ul>
    
    
    


<p>
    We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys. You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study. These surveys and tasks should take you about 20 minutes each week. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions and the right to participate in particular aspects of the study. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What we will and will not do with the data?</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>De-identification</strong>: In order to preserve your privacy, we will use a random code instead of your name on all your study data. This unique
    code cannot be used to directly identify you. Any data that directly identifies you will be removed before the data is transferred for analysis, although
    researchers will have the ability to contact you if you have chosen to allow them to do so.<strong> </strong>We will never sell, rent or lease your contact
    information.</li>
	<li><strong>Use in research:</strong> We will combine your study data including survey responses and other measurements with those of other study participants. The combined data will be transferred to Synapse, a computational research platform, for analysis. The research team will analyze the combined data and report findings back to the community through Blog or scientific publications. The combined study data on Synapse will also be available to use for other research purposes and will be shared with registered users worldwide who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.</li>
    <li>We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text message content, or websites visited.</li>
</ul>



<p>
    <strong>RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful thought.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from participating.      </li>
    <li>Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer.      </li>
    <li>Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel self-conscious. You can avoid that by putting a passcode on your phone to block unauthorized users from accessing your phone content.      </li>
    <li>Be safe – just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform tasks!       </li>
    <li>You may have concerns about data security, privacy and confidentiality. We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her. This risk, while very low, should still be contemplated prior to enrolling.       </li>
    <li>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.      </li>
    <li>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time.       </li>
    <li>You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.      </li>
    
</ul>



<p>
    <strong>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of this study is to create knowledge that can benefit us as a society. The benefits are primarily the creation of insights to help current and future patients and their families to better detect, understand and manage their health. We will return the insights learned from analysis of the study data through the study website, but these insights may not be of direct benefit to you. We cannot, and thus we do not, guarantee or promise that you will personally receive any direct benefits from this study. However you will be able to track your health and export your data at will to share with your medical doctor and anyone you choose.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PAYMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You will not be paid for being in this study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>COSTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is no cost to you to participate in this study other than to your mobile data plan if applicable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since no medical treatments are provided during this study there are no alternative therapies. The only alternative is to not participate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>AUTHORIZATION TO USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in a research study without your written authorization.
    If you sign this consent form, you will provide that authorization. You do not have to sign this form. But if you do not, you will not be able to
    participate in this research study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What personal information will be used or disclosed?</strong>
    Your personal health information that may be used or disclosed in connection with this research study, may include, but is not limited to your body height,
    weight, gender, age, ethnicity/race, health history, answers to study questions, and health information that may be discernable from your mobile phone’s
    sensors. Your account information, study data and signed consent form may also be looked at and/or copied by designated personnel for regulatory and
    quality assurance. WE WILL NEVER SELL, RENT OR LEASE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who may use and disclose my data? </strong>
    The study sponsor, investigators, study coordinators and study staff may use and disclose your personal information to do the research described above or
    as required by law (e.g. to prevent possible injury to yourself or others). Any registered Synapse user may use the combined study data; however no name or
    contact information will be included in this study dataset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who May Receive or Use the Information?</strong>
    The parties listed in the preceding paragraph may disclose your health information as required by law to:
</p>
<p>
    · The US National Institute of health, National Cancer Institute, Office for Human Research Protection, The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies
    as required,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Governmental agencies in other countries,
    </li>
    <li>
        Western Institutional Review Board<sup>®</sup> (WIRB<sup>®</sup>) or other Institutional Review Board who watch over the safety, effectiveness and
        conduct of the research,
    </li>
    <li>
        Others, if the law requires
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>When will my authorization expire?</strong>
    Your authorization for the use and/or disclosure of your health information will expire if you choose to withdraw from the research study or by December
    31, 2060.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to withdraw from the research study, we will stop collecting your study data. At the end of the study period we will stop collecting your
    data, even if the application remains on your phone and you keep using it. If you were interested in joining another study afterward, we would ask you to
    complete another consent, like this one, explaining the risks and benefits of the new study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We are committed to protect your privacy. Your identity will be kept as confidential as possible. Except as required by law, you will not be identified by name or by any other direct personal identifier. We will use a random code number instead of your name on all your data collected, analyzed, aggregated and released to researchers. Information about the code will be kept in a secure system. This study anticipates that your data will be added to a combined study dataset placed in a “repository” - an online database – like Sage Bionetworks Synapse where other researchers can access it. No name or contact information will be included in this combined study dataset. Researchers will have access to all the study data but will be unable to easily map any particular data to the identities of the participants. However, there is always a risk that the database can be breached by hackers, or that experts in re-identification may attempt to reverse our processes. Total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>COMPENSATION FOR INJURY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION, HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE TO PARTICIPANTS.
</p>
<p>
    If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator or the medical monitor and the research study staff
    will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this
    treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your insurance.
</p>
<p>
    If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance, managed care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible
    for these costs. The sponsor will not routinely pay charges that your insurance does not cover. No payment is routinely available from the study sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to sign this consent form. But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this
    research study. You may decide not to participate or you may leave the study at any time. Your decision will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits
    to which you are entitled.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You should not feel obligated to participate in this study.</li>
	<li>Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction.</li>
    <li>You have a right to download or transfer a copy of all of your study data.   </li>
    <li>By agreeing to participate you do not waive any of your legal rights.   </li>
   
</ul>
    
<p>
    To withdraw from this study please contact the Study Principal Investigator Dr. Stephen Friend, by email <a href="BCSApp@sagebase.org">BCSApp@sagebase.org</a> or call +1 206-667-2103.
</p>
<p>
    If you withdraw from the study, we will stop collecting new data but the de-identified data that you have already provided will not be able to be destroyed
    or deleted. Your identity will not be kept.
</p>
<p>
    The Study Director or the sponsor may also withdraw you from the study without your consent at any time for any reason, including if it is in your best
    interest, you do not consent to continue in the study after being told of changes in the research that may affect you, or if the study is cancelled.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Several databases are available to help researchers understand different diseases. These databases contain information and other data helpful to study
    diseases. This study will include your research data into one such database, Synapse, to be used in research beyond this study. Your data may benefit
    future research.
</p>
<p>
    Before your data is released to the Synapse database, your personal contact information such as your name, e-mail, etc, will be removed. Your unique code
    identifier will be used in place of your name when your data is released onto Synapse. The study data will be made available on Synapse to registered users
    who have agreed to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them
    to do so. The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the study data released through Synapse.
</p>
<p>
    Although you can withdraw from the study at any time, you cannot withdraw the de-identified data that have already been distributed through research
    databases.
</p>
<p>
    The main risk of donating your de-identified data to a centralized database is the potential loss of privacy and confidentiality in case of public
    disclosure due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your
    data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes by someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to try to re-identify you. This risk is low.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE STUDY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The sponsor is Sage Bionetworks <a href="http://sagebase.org/">http://sagebase.org/</a> with some funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
