This study is designed for women between 18 and 80 years old with a history of breast cancer treatment and women without any history of cancer. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.\n\nTo be in a research study you must give your informed consent. The purpose of this form is to help you decide if you want to participate in this study. Please read the information carefully. If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be given a copy of this signed and dated consent form. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent, and to discontinue participation at any time.\n\nYou should not join the research study until all of your questions are answered.\n\nParticipating in a research study is not the same as receiving medical care. The decision to join or not join the research study will not affect your medical benefits.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY \nWomen recovering from breast cancer treatment can have very different and more or less severe symptoms day to day. These symptoms affect quality of life and make managing recovery difficult. We would like to understand the causes of these symptom variations.\n\nNew technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time. This study will monitor your health and symptoms using questionnaires and sensors via a mobile phone application.\n\nIf you decide to join the study you will need to download the study application on your mobile device. Then, periodically we will ask you to answer questions and/or perform some tasks on your mobile phone. These questions may be about your health, exercise, diet, sleep and medicines, in addition to some more general health surveys. The tasks may include exercising or journaling about your week. Your study data will include your responses to surveys and tasks and some measurements from the phone itself about how you are moving and interacting with others.\n\nYour data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants and made available to groups of researchers worldwide for analysis and future research. You also will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data. We anticipate this study will be open for multiple years, during which time your data will remain available to you to review. We anticipate enrolling 20,000 subjects in this study.\n\nThe sponsor is Sage Bionetworks with some funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n";

You may choose to leave any questions that you do not wish to answer blank. We will ask you to rate your fatigue, cognition, sleep, mood and exercise performance on a scale of 1 to 5 daily. In addition to these daily questions we will ask you to answer brief weekly and monthly surveys about your symptoms in order to track any changes.\n\nTasks: Occasionally we will ask you to perform specific tasks while using your mobile phone and record sensor data directly from your phone. For example, you may be asked to type a short journal entry, which will then be shared and analyzed for typing speed and accuracy as well as word usage. Additionally, you may be asked to provide data from third-party fitness devices (like the Fitbit or Jawbone Up) with your permission.\nWe will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys. You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study. These surveys and tasks should take you about 20 minutes each week. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions and the right to participate in particular aspects of the study.";

These databases contain information and other data helpful to study diseases. This study will include your research data into one such database, Synapse, to be used in future research beyond this study. Your data may benefit future research.\n\nBefore your data is released to the Synapse database, your personal contact information such as your name, e-mail, etc, will be removed.

The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the study data released through Synapse.\n\nAlthough you can withdraw from the study at any time, you cannot withdraw the de-identified data that have already been distributed through research databases.\n\nThe main risk of donating your de-identified data to a centralized database is the potential loss of privacy and confidentiality in case of public disclosure due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes by someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to try to re-identify you. This risk is low.";
